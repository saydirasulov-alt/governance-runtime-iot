# Table 12 (replacement): AI-failure characterization vs independent physical oracle

All values are means over 30 seeds (2000 intents/seed); 95% bootstrap CIs in brackets.

| Metric | Context-blind gate [15,30] | Context-aware policy |
|---|---|---|
| ROC AUC | 0.948 [0.946, 0.949] | 0.984 [0.984, 0.985] |
| Recall (hazards caught) | 0.511 [0.505, 0.518] | (Youden) 0.886 |
| False-negative rate | 0.489 [0.482, 0.495] | -- |
| False-positive rate | 0.013 [0.012, 0.014] | 0.110 |
| Precision | 0.948 [0.944, 0.952] | -- |

Hazard decomposition: in-scope global-band hazards caught 9542/9542 (100.0%); context-relative hazards caught 0/9122 (0.0%). Context-relative hazards are 48.9% of all hazards and are structurally invisible to a context-blind gate.
